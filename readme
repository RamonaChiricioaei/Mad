MAd
Create an innovative hypermedia experience that helps middle-/high-school students to learn more about specific medical conditions 
– common diseases, allergies, food intolerances, obesity factors, disorders, etc. – and how these conditions can affect the human 
body + the population of a given geographical area (such as a town, country, continent) based on specific conditions: climate, 
industrial development, population density, cultural factors, etc. As knowledge sources, at least DBpedia and/or Wikidata will 
be used, in addition to various datasets provided by European Data Portal, ExpoFacts or Gapminder World. Bonus: providing various 
suggestions (recommendations) about an "optimal" (healthy) lifestyle and possible useful drugs via DrugBank.
